## Abstract

Deployment of Hadoop and Spark on Raspberry Pi Clusters which involves:
* Installing Hadoop and Spark on Clusters
* Developing a REST service that submits Hadoop/Spark jobs to the cluster remotely
* Creating a cluster with as many nodes as we have SD cards for
* Switching across clusters between Hadoop and Spark using a REST Service

## Introduction

## Related Work

## Architecture

## Technologies used

* cm-burn
* cloudmesh-inventory
* Python
* REST
* HDFS
* Hadoop
* Spark

## Work Breakdown

## Progress

* Burning SD Cards using Etcher on Windows
* Read about battery operated clock for Raspberry Pis, NTP and RTC
* Setting up the cluster

## Benchmark and Evaluation 

* Develop a test program to review Hadoop and Spark on Clusters
* Use PyTest
