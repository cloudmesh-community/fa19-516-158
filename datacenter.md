The Carbon Emission for "Inner Mongolia Information Park" is 0 because China has moved into reduction of CO2. This is to ensure eco friendly environment. Since this data centre is being built, it plans on reducing all emissions.

Abundant power supply, favorable climatic conditions, availability of skilled staff and preferential policies are major reasons why the data centre is popular. 
Inner Mongolia Information Park Data Centre is located in Inner Mongolia, China. It is owned by China Telecom. This is the largest data centre in Hohhot, the capital of Inner Mongolia. 

It was established in 2016. "In 2016, the region designated the big data and cloud computing industries as new engines for local development, vowing that the regional big data industry's output value will exceed 100 billion yuan (14.5 billion U. S. dollars) in 2020." [1] 

The IT Load is 150MW = 150 * 1000 = 150,000kW. The data centre is operated for 24 hours. So, the electricity cost would be 150,000 * 24 = $241,200,000. The yearly cost projected is around $14.5billion+ by 2020. [5]

Since the yearly CO2 footprint is being minimized every year, it is hard to estimate the exact figure but it is nearly 6 tons. [2] [3]

* My residential home in Bloomington is in an apartment building with more than 6+ units. 
* It is an air-conditioned home with electricity usage used to power the fuel. 
* I do not own a vehicle. 
* I travel about 10 miles in the campus bus and 10 miles in the inter city bus per week. 
* I generally take one long flight once a year.
* According to my usage, my carbon footprint is 18,724LBS of CO2.

All major data centres at Facebook, Google and the ones in China use Hydro as their renewal energy. Electricity is the main source for data centres to power their systems. It is essential to keep this in check at all times. Infact, all major data centres including Microsoft and other IT related companies are moving towards sustainable environment and using energy-efficient sources. Most of these data centres are looking at doing this to ensure they are not harming the environment. They ensure that by doing so, they are well-known and qualified vendors all over the world. In the wake of the changing environment and pollution due to various emissions in daily life, renewal energy is looked at serious by all data centres.

"Mongolia Information Park can make use of free air cooling for up to eight months a year. "Power suppliers are also taking a keen interest in the Hohhot Cloud Computing Base. Beijing Energy Investment Holding said it will build a 2×350 MW and 2×600 MW cogeneration plant with 8.5bn CNY. While Inner Mongolia Electric Power Co said it will invest 1.11bn CNY for building one 500kV substation and two 220kV substations." [7]

"Hohhot gets 7.7m kW from a mixture of thermal and hydroelectric sources, but is projected to gain another 1.8m kW after work is finished on a new thermal power facility." [8] Hohhot generates so much hydroelectric power beacuse yearly average of over a foot of rain adds to its 1.2 billion cubic meter reserve of water.

"China’s hyperscale data center industry is the second largest in the world, comprising 8% of the global
market. Researchers estimate that in 2018 China was home to 1.2 million server racks from large and ultralarge scale data centers and 1.5 million server racks from small and mid-scale data centers. China’s data center industry consumed 161 TWh of
electricity in 2018.35% of the country’s total electricity consumption. Researchers found that electricity consumption from the industry is on track to increase by 66% in the next five years, reaching 267 TWh by 2023, more than Australia’s total 2018 electricity consumption. In a typical data center in China, 80% of electricity is consumed by servers and cooling equipment." [4]

Renewable Energy and impact of country's dynamics on the environment have been major factors for China over the past decade. Several initiatives have been taken to ensure that China is technology driven in eco friendly ways. But, electricity is one thing that was not paid much attention to. Now, significant efforts have been taken at data centres to ensure that there is cost cutting even in the electricity sector.

In May 2017, British Airways filed a lawsuit against its data centre supplier CBRE. Around 700 flights were cancelled and 75,000 people were left stranded. It costed them 80 million Euros. This could be a factor that the ticket prices of British Airlines came down in 2018.

"Simon Allen, Membership Secretary at the UK Data Centre Interest Group (DCIG), and one of the key responsible for the DCIRN, said: “The airline industry has an enviable record of continuously improving flight safety by industry-wide sharing of accident and potential accident information,” he said.
“However, the same is not the case in the data centre industry where it is common practice to cover up failures or potential disasters in a misguided attempt to protect reputations.
“Root cause investigation findings are normally secret and bound by NDA which has resulted in The Data Centre industry being at a disadvantage in learning from failures.”" [6]

Similarly, in August 206, Delta Airlines cancelled 2,000 flights in 3 days. It costed them $150million. The reason was that an electrical component which provided power to the airline's data centre failed and caused the shutdown of the data centre. 

Therefore, this shows that data centre outages play a significant part in Airlines. Passengers waiting for their flights, check-in passengers would face major difficulties and hit the media everytime. People would tend to book flights in other airlines.

A piece of electrical component at its Atlanta headquarters failed which led to a shutdown of the transformer providing power to the airline’s data centre.
